This is a form builder website built by using react typescript where the user can build a form without writing the code. If required the user can also retrieve the code from the website itself if necessary.

The website is divided into 3 columns.
The tools column where the user selects the required fields for building a form
The form builder column to where the user drags the field to build a form. Here, the user can also drag the fields, change the settings of the field and delete the field.
The preview column where the output of the form builder is shown. Additionally, there is a code section in this column where the user can copy the code formed by adding the fields to the form builder.

Steps to build a form using this form builder:
Drag any field from the first column to the form builder section (second column)
Click the setting icon on the right side of the field to use the field according to your need.
A modal will open where you can change the name, placeholder and many other settings of the fields as per the requirement.
Drag the fields to change the position of the fields if misplaced by using the drag icon on the left side of the field
Delete the field if not required simply by clicking the delete icon on the right side of the field
Preview the output of your form builder on the 3rd column
The third column consists of another tab called ‘code’ where you can copy the code and use it in your website to use the same form you built using the form builder.
